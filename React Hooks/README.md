# React Hooks

In this section, we'll explore React Hooks in depth. We'll cover how to use them correctly, offer guidance on best practices, and highlight common mistakes to avoid.

## Historical View On Hooks

In earlier versions of React, there were two main ways to create a component: Class Components and Function Components. Function Components were primarily used for rendering JSX and lacked access to React's main features, such as state management and lifecycle methods.

With the modernization of React, Hooks were introduced as a solution to allow Function Components to access these key features. As a result, there is no longer a need to use Class Components. The official React documentation now supports and recommends using Function Components with Hooks, indicating a shift away from Class Components in future support.
